# Hello Markdown

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

must have space between asterisk and text, if not preview show like below

*Remember the basic syntax
*Write your doc
*Done!

Now you can be a Wiz at this *language and code up stuff like*  'console.writeline("Hello Markdown");

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
